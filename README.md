    Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
    Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
    Peak: View the front element without removing it.
    Display: Show all elements in the queue.
    Check Full: Verify if the queue is full.
    Check Empty: Verify if the queue is empty.
